      <p>Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis' office is continuing to refuse issuing same-sex marriage licenses despite the U.S. Supreme court decision that gay marriage bans are unconstitutional, arguing that signing the license would violate her Christian beliefs. Five couples have since sued her and she was ordered to comply with the Supreme Court ruling by U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning, who explained that "her religious convictions cannot excuse her from performing the duties that she took an oath to perform as Rowan County Clerk." </p>

	  <p2>Things are Getting Hairy</p2>
	  <p> "There's all kinds of beauty standards and all of them are influenced by a a patriarchal society, obviously. I think that by me growing out my armpit hair I’m challenging that. People that identify as women [have been told they have] to be hairless to be considered attractive … and that’s obviously not true.”</p>

		<p>Rebelling against society's stigma against female armpit hair, women have begun dying their armpit hair bright, bold colors. In response, there has been both positive and negative backlash on social media.</p>

      <p>Kiran Gandhi ran the London Marathon while menstruating without any feminine products(i.e. tampons or pads) not only for her own comfort, but also to encourage women not to be ashamed of their periods and to bring awareness to women who don't have access to feminine products at all. The story went viral and resulted in quite a bit of backlash (positive and negative) on social media.</p>

      <p>Andrea Gonzales and Sophie Houser, two high schoolers and participants in the 2014 Girls Who Code summer immersion program, used code to create social change in the form of a video game. The goal of the game, called Tampon Run, beyond de-stigmatizing menstruation is for the heroine to collect tampons and shoot them at the villains.</p>

	<p>Disgruntled by strings of "femiNAZIsm" in the feminist movement, some women are beginning to look for gender equality in the meninist movement. Meninism is a movement fighting for men's rightsand
	equality with women, and has manifested largely in social media in the form of sexist and anti-feminist tweets, including those posted from the account Meninist Tweets. Meninist Tweets insists that the movement is a a mere "parody," but posts "jokes" about sexual assault.</p>
